## Paper outline

Target journal: PLOS Comp Bio?? Genome Reseach (as Centrifuge)?? Nature Scientific Reports?? Genome Biology (as Kraken)???

Proposed title: ProPhyle: accurate and resource-frugal phylogeny-based metagenomic classification

Goals of paper: 
* announce ProPhyle
* demonstrate convincingly that (a) more accurate, and (b) much more memory efficient, than Kraken (and Centrifuge)

Model articles:
* ??

## Plan (structure taken from PLOS)

#### Abstract
##### Keywords: next-generation sequencing, metagenomic classification, phylogeny, alignment-free sequence comparison

#### Author summary

### Introduction

### Results

### Discussion

Explain carefully how ProPhyle relates to Kraken and Centrifuge.

Kraken: 
* we are better in accuracy (explain why Kraken's experiments and numbers are misleading)
* we are much better in memory
* we are not too much worse in time (?)

Centrifuge:
* ProPhyle shares with Centrifuge similar ideas -- "propagating" common sequences, using BWT -- but does it in a more rigorous way
