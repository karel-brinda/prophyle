# How to run experiments

This procedure should be performed whenever a major
update is going to be merged to master.

1. Clean all subdirectories
   
  ```
  make clean
  ```

2. Adjust parts of Makefile responsible for logs if it is necessary (e.g., in case of a new feature)

3. Activate the Conda environment

  ```
  conda activate prophyle
  ```
  
4. Run the experiments (with the same number as your machine has)

  ```
  make -j 24
  ```

5. Collect logs
  ```
  ./view_logs_md.sh > _logs/paprika_NB_BRANCHENAME.md
  ./view_logs_txt.sh > _logs/paprika_NB_BRANCHENAME.txt
  ```

6. Create a git commit and push it to the repository

7. Verify that logs look correct and that RPM and memory footprint did not change much compared to the previous log (if yes, there is probably a problem)

8. If everything is OK, merge with master
